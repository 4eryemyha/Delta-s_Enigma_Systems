# Project Description

Delta's Enigma is an exciting adventure game set on a mysterious planet where players must navigate extreme conditions to survive. With its vibrant, cartoon-style graphics, the game immerses players in a world filled with diverse landscapes, from lush jungles to perilous wastelands, where both hidden opportunities and deadly threats await.

Players will gather resources and craft various items through an in-depth inventory and crafting system. They can create weapons, tools, and devices by combining materials, giving them the freedom to adapt and survive in the harsh environment.

A key feature of the game is its exploration system. Players can study the planet’s unique flora and fauna, unlocking new survival options and improving their skills. This helps them develop more effective strategies to handle different challenges.

The planet is also home to many enemies, each with its own behaviors and difficulty levels. Players will need to figure out how to best approach each enemy, whether by confronting them or avoiding danger.

To make traveling across the vast planet easier, Delta's Enigma offers various forms of transport. This allows players to quickly explore the world and adapt to new challenges, giving them more strategic options along the way.

Every element of the game, from the inventory system to the dynamic enemies, is designed to create a deeply engaging and thrilling adventure where every decision counts.
